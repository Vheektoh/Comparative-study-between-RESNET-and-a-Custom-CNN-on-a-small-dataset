The dataset used for this study was gotten from the online kaggle repository using the link
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyapmaher/fruits-dataset-images

This image dataset showcases 9 popular fruits including mango, banana, cherry, strawberry,
chickoo, grapes, kiwi, orange, and apple. Each fruit is represented by a collection of
high-quality images that highlight their unique color, texture, and shape.
The RESNET and the custom CNN were tested to show the strenght of generalization and also the
effects of using a pre-trained model on a small dataset.
the results showed the RESNET performed better than the custom CNN
